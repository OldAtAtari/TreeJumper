# TreeJumper
This simple Atari Lynx game was created only as a way to learn various Lynx programming techniques and tools. It contains
sprites, movement, sounds, and an intro screen. It also keeps track of the score and number of lives. I've tried to pu
t detailed comments in the code so that it might be of use to the next person trying to learn these things.

It is based on game.c in the /game/ directory of the template, which was created originally by karri and added to by Nop
90 in the AtariAge Lynx Programming forum.

I used Chipper to create the sound effects. Credit goes to Sage for creating that tool.

Thanks also to 42bs, Turbo Laser Lynx, and others for helping me learn what I've learned so far.

To compile the code, unzip or clone the complete package in a directory on your Linux machine. Then enter "make" at the
command line in the /treeJumper/ directory. This should work if you've already set up karri's version of the Linx tools,
 specifically cc65.

The treeJumper.lnx file is in the /treeJumper/cart/ directory.
